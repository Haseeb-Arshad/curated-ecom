- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions with subtle lift effect (`translateY(-1px)`)
- **Spacing**: Optimized gap between chips to `0.625rem`
- **Badge Support**: Added visual indicators for "New" and "Picks" categories

#### Count Display
- Changed from badge-style to **superscript** format
- Positioned as `<sup>` element next to category name

- Positioned at the end of the category row

#### Special Badges
- **New Badge**: Green indicator dot (`#10b981`)
- **Picks Badge**: Orange indicator dot (`#f59e0b`)
- Positioned at top-right corner of chip with subtle glow effect

### 2. ProductCard Component (`ProductCard.module.css`)

#### Card Structure
- **Border Radius**: Increased to `18px` for softer appearance
- **Padding**: Increased to `1.25rem` for better spacing
- **Border**: Lighter border color (`#ebebeb`)
- **Shadow**: Enhanced hover shadow for depth (`0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`)

#### Image Container
- **Border Radius**: `14px` for rounded image corners

### 3. FilterChips Component Logic (`FilterChips.tsx`)

- Added `badge?: "new" | "picks"` property to Category interface
- Support for rendering badge indicators on chips

#### Rendering Changes
- Count rendered as `<sup>` inside label span
- Conditional rendering of badge dots based on category type

### 4. Index Route (`_index.tsx`)

#### New Categories
- Added **"New"** category with green badge indicator (12 items)
- Added **"Picks"** category with orange badge indicator (8 items)
- Custom icons for both special categories

#### Category Order
```
All → New → Picks → Tech → Workspace → Home → Carry → Books → Lifestyle
```

#### Filtering Logic
- Enhanced to handle "New" and "Picks" categories
- All category counts dynamically calculated from product data

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Consistency**
- Uniform border radii and spacing
- Consistent color palette using grays and blacks
- Smooth transitions (0.18s-0.22s cubic-bezier)

### 2. **Hierarchy**
- Active chip stands out with black background
- Superscript counts are subtle yet informative
- Clear visual distinction between card states

### 3. **Interactivity**
- Hover states provide clear feedback
- Smooth micro-animations enhance user experience
- Focus states maintain accessibility

### 4. **Polish**
- Careful attention to shadow depths
- Subtle color transitions
- Refined typography with negative letter spacing

## Visual Improvements Summary

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chip Active State | Gray background | Black background with white text |
| Count Display | Badge pill | Superscript number |
| See More | Button with border | Text link |
| Card Hover | Small lift | Enhanced lift with stronger shadow |
| Category Badges | None | Colored dots for New/Picks |
| Arrow Button | Simple | Enhanced with backdrop blur |

## Browser Compatibility
All CSS features used are widely supported:
- CSS custom properties

- Backdrop filter (with fallback)
- Modern transitions and transforms

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add actual data filters for "New" and "Picks" categories
2. Implement scroll fade indicators for category chips on mobile
3. Add loading states for product images
4. Consider dark mode variants
